I'm a design student at Deakin University. I've zero experience and understanding of code. However, I know the importance for a designer to understand the language for front-end coding at least. My repository file update will be slow since I have to study the language and apply it to the practical at the same time.
This repository is a reflection of all my weekly practical work.
I hope you enjoy your time here!
